# Build a Todo App

In this `Start Building` section, we will be building a simple Todo App with the following features:

- `Adding` new todo
- `Delete` a todo
- `Complete` a todo
- `Filtering` todos
- `Persist` our todo list with **Local Storage**

The best way to learn is not just by building the todo app with Pinia, is to also learn how to integrate it in an existing project.

We will build our **Todo App** with our normal `Options API`, then integrate `Pinia` store.
